Domains:
Global Dimension:
- The entire problem as a whole.
    - For example an entire image.
- Local Dimension: (Work Groups)
    - A smaller scope of the problem domain.
    - Can be thought of as mapped to one "core" / Compute Unit.
- Work Item:
    - Can be thought of as a thread in terms of control flow.
        - However one can run multiple work items on one threads,
          for example by running separate work items in separate lanes of an SSE Vector.

Memory:
Private: per work-item.
Local: Shared within a work group.
Constant: Visible to all work groups.
Global: Visible to all work groups.
Host Memory: memory on the cpu.

Basic platform categories:
Context:
- Is the one mainly interacted with by host code.
- Contains one or more devices, device memory and one or more command queues.

Command Queues:
- Tied to a single device in a context.
- All commands for a device is sent through the device queue.
- Two different queues, refers to execution order.
    - Out of order.
    - In order.

Memory Objects:
- 2 types.
- Buffers:
    - 
- Images
    - Image2d
    - Image3d

Programs:
- Source-code and binary.

Kernels:
- Small "functions", run on each core(?).

General Flow:
Compile code -> Create data & arguments -> Send to execution.
