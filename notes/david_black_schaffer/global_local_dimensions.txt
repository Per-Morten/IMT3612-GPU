How to speficy parallelism.
- Parallelism is defined by 1D, 2D, or 3D, global dimensions for each kernel execution.
- A work-item (thread) is executed for every point in the global dimensions.

Examples:   
1k audio:           1024            1024 work-items.
HD video:           1920x1080         2M work-items.
3D MRI:             256x256x256      16M work-items.
HD per line:        1080            1080 work-items.
HD per 8x8 block:   240x135          32k work-items.

Local Dimensions:
- Global dimensions are broken down evenly into local work-groups.
    - Global Dimensions: 100x512.
    - Local Dimensions: 10x8, 100x1, 50x2, 2x128.
    - Invalid Local Dimensions: 10x10, 16x16.
- Each work-group is logically executed together on one compute unit.
- Synchronization is only allowed between work-items in the same work-group
