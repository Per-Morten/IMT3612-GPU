OpenCL vs CUDA.
- CUDA has better tools, language, and features.
- OpenCL Supports more devices.
- They're basically the same.
    - If you can figure out how to make your algorithms run well on one it will work well on the other.
    - Both strongly reflect GPU architectures of 2009.
    - Slowly evolving to support more modern features. 
    - Memory spaces and multiple kernels.

Which one to choose.
- Personal Project:         CUDA.
- Performance at all costs: CUDA.
- Professional product:     OpenCL.
- This course:              OpenCL.
